/*
first we have introduced arrays , 

1. they are linear 
2. address are contigious 
3. elements can be searched by index ..

but 
1. Fixed size , they arent usually dynamic 


so we introduced vectors .
but vector <int> arr(5)

but even after 5 elements 
you can do arr.push_back (10)

it will create but another vector <int> arr(5)

but you cant see , 
and then memory location will not be contigious 


so we need a new linear data structure named linked list
